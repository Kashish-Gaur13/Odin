    <h>Flex shorthand</h>
    <p>the flex shorthand is actually a shorthand for 3 properties
         that you can set on a flex item</p>
         <p>shorthand properties are css properties that let you set the v
            values of multiple other css properties
         </p>
         <p>flex is actually a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink 
            and flex-basis
            <div>{
                <p>flex : 0 1 0%;</p>
                <p>       ^ ^ ^</p> 
                      <p> | | |</p>
                <p>flex-grow| |</p>
                <p>flex-shrink|</p>
                   <p>flex-basis </p>  
            }</div>
            <p>the default value of flex property is shown 
                flex grow : 0
                flex shrink:1
                flex basis:0
            </p>
            <h>flex grow</h>
            <p>expects a single number value as its value and that nuumber
                is used to flex-item's "growth factor".
                flex:1 tells every div to grow the same amount
                if we add flex:2 to just one of the divs, then
                that div would grow 2x the size of others
            </p>
            <div class="flex">
                <div class="one"></div>
                <div class="two"></div>
                <div class="three"></div>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h>flex shrink</h>
        <p>similar to flex grow, but sets the shrink factor 
            of a flex item.  
            it is applied if the size of all flex items is larger
            than their parent container.

        </p>
        <p>whenever we apply flex grow or shrink, flex items do not necessarily respect 
           the given values for width.when their parent is big enough, 
           they grow to fill it. Likewise, when the parent is too small, 
           the default behavior is for them to shrink to fit.
        </p>
        <h>flex basis</h>
        <p>it simply sets the initial size of a flex item, so that
            any sort of flex growing or shrinking starts from that
            baseline size. default is flex-basis:0%
        </p>
        <p>The reason to change flex-basis to auto is that with the basis
         set to 0, those items would ignore the item's width, and 
         everything would shrink evenly. Using auto as a flex-basis 
         tells the item to check for a width declaration </p>
