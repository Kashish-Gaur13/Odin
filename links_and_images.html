    <h1>Links and Images</h1>
    <!-- an html attribute is made up of two parts: a name and a value. -->
     <!-- generally there are two linds of links we create:
    1. links to pages on other websites on the internet (absolute links)
    2. links to pages located on our own website (relative links)-->
    <a href="index.html">CLICK ME</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">click me!</a>

    <!-- IMAGES 
    to display an image we use img tag. doesnt have a closing tag bec instead 
     wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image onto
         the page using src attribute. -->

    <!-- 
        4 main image formats we can use on web: jpg gif png and svg
        jpg are used for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly 
        increasing file size. this makes them great for photos amd images
        with lots of gradients in them. they dont allow transparent pixels

     <p> GIF mochi </p>
     <!-- gifs are the go to option for simple animations, but the trade off is
        that they are somehwat limited in terms of color palette, never use them for photos
    transoarent pixels are a binary option for gifs, meaning u cant have semi opaque pixels -->
    <img src="./mochi.gif">
    <p>PNG images</p>
    <!-- great for anything thats not a photo or animated. they deal w opacity just fine.
    they dont have a color palette limitation. excellent for icons, technical diagrams, logos -->
    <img src="./mochi.png">
    <p>SVG images</p>
    <!-- svg is a vector based graphics format, menaing it can scale up or down to any dimension
    without the loss of quality. wonderful tool for responsive design -->
